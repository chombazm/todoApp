This is a react app that displays todo items.
It gets todo items from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos and displays them using an array.
If an item is completed, it is marked with a line-through and not marked otherwise
It is being hosted on https://todo-team.netlify.com. Make your contributions and send your pull requests with a netlify preview URL.
